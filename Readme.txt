This is a repository for the utilities of the future main project within of which there will be several mini projects. Each mini project has a separate folder that includes the source code and other extra materials. Our first mini project is called Residential_PV_Adoption in which a model for solar adoption was built in Netlogo. The model describes the adoption over time of residential PV under realistic assumptions regarding consumer behavior. The second mini project is called Utility Death Spiral in which we Employed an ABM approach and data from two case studies to examine the extent to which solar photovoltaic (PV for short) penetration can erode utility revenues and undercut the traditional financial model of power companies, leading to a so-called “death spiral” of the utility business.
